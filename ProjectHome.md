**master's thesis of Daniel Limberger**

osgHimmel is a [OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) (OSG) extending lib that allows visualization of background imagery in arbitrary scenegraphs. Thereby two different techniques are available:

  * First: real-time computation of a physical based model for topocentric observers on earth at a specific date-time. Sun, moon and star positions, atmosphere, and weather are procedurally generated.

  * Second: various texture mapped skies with dynamic, time based texture transitions, rotation, horizon blending as well as an optional "faked" sun.
